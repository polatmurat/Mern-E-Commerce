# mern e-Commerce

The e-commerce system I have developed is based on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack philosophy, compiled from the tutorials I have been following. It includes React, Redux, Express JS, and NodeJS as its core technologies. Additionally, Redux Toolkit Query is used for data binding, and the code is open to modifications; I will consider pull requests. Feel free to provide code improvements or any questions that come to your mind!

I must mention that the inspiration for this project comes from a tutorial whose link I will provide below. It is evident that it is not a direct clone, as I have established a distinct foundation with more effective use of bindings, connections, and the object-oriented programming (OOP) philosophy. I don't particularly like cloned projects, but Therefore, I have no problem sharing this repository since it stands out with a scenario that sharply distinguishes itself from a simple clone.
